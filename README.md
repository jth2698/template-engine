## Description
A simple CLI allowing users to build a `team.html` file containing key information for the user's employee team members. The CLI is built with JavaScript and utilizes node.js to run the CLI. The source code relies on an "Employee" class and three employee-type subclasses to build unique html <divs> for each team member.

## Installation
The user should git clone to the user's preferred directory.

## Usage
The project requires `node.js` and includes a `package.json` file. Therefore, once node.js is installed, the user can run `npm install` from within the root directory for all dependencies. Dependencies include npm packages `inquirer` and `jest`. Once dependencies are installed, the user should run `node app.js` to open the CLI prompt within the terminal.

## Contribution Guidelines
All pull requests are reviewed and considered.

## Testing
`jest` is included as a dependency, so tests can be run at any time from the root directory using `npm run test`. The test directory included with the project includes all current test files.
